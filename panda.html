               <h3>PANDA</h3>
<p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a bear native to south-central China. These iconic black-and-white bears are actually carnivores that evolved to eat almost exclusively bamboo.</p>
<p>Pandas spend 10-16 hours daily eating up to 40 pounds of bamboo. Their "thumb" is actually an extended wrist bone that helps them grip bamboo stalks.</p>
<p>Newborn pandas weigh only 3-5 ounces - about 1/900th of their mother's weight! Our pandas are part of an international conservation effort to protect this vulnerable species.</p>
<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>Our panda habitat is located in the Asian Highlands section (enclosure H5), featuring a climate-controlled indoor area and bamboo forest.</p>
