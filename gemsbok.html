                <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
<p>The gemsbok (Oryx gazella) is a large antelope native to the arid regions of Southern Africa. With their striking black and white facial markings and long, straight horns, they're one of the most recognizable desert animals.</p>
<p>These magnificent creatures can survive without water for extended periods, getting moisture from the plants they eat. Their light-colored coats reflect sunlight, while specialized blood vessels in their noses cool incoming air.</p>
<p>Gemsbok can defend themselves against predators like lions by using their rapier-like horns which can grow up to 33 inches (85 cm) long. They typically live in herds of 10-40 animals.</p>
<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>You'll find our gemsbok herd at enclosure D7  in the African Savannah section, near the desert habitat.</p>
