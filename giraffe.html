                <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
<p>The giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is the world's tallest land animal, with males reaching up to 18 feet (5.5 m) in height. Their distinctive long necks contain only seven vertebrae - the same number as humans!</p>
<p>Giraffes have 18-inch tongues that are dark blue to protect against sunburn while reaching for leaves. Their spotted patterns are unique like fingerprints, and help with temperature regulation and camouflage.</p>
<p>Despite their size, giraffes only sleep about 30 minutes per day in short naps. Their blood pressure is twice that of humans, requiring special valves to prevent fainting when they bend down.</p>
<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>Our giraffe family can be seen at enclosure A3 in the African Plains area, near the viewing platform.</p>
