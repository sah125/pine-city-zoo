               <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
<p>The warthog (Phacochoerus africanus) is a wild member of the pig family found in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite their comical appearance, they're surprisingly fast runners and formidable when threatened.</p>
<p>Warthogs have distinctive facial "warts" that protect them during fights. They kneel on their calloused front knees to eat low-growing plants, and often reverse into burrows so they can defend the entrance.</p>
<p>These resilient animals can survive months without water during dry seasons. Their tusks are actually elongated canine teeth that continuously grow.</p>
<strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
<p>Our warthog family can be seen at enclosure D3 in the African Savannah section, where they share space with meerkats.</p>
